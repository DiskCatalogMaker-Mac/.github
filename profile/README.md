## 📦 What is DiskCatalogMaker for Mac?

DiskCatalogMaker for Mac is a professional-grade disk cataloging tool built specifically for macOS users who need to manage large libraries of files stored across various drives, disks, or external storage media. Whether you archive data to CDs, DVDs, USB drives, or network volumes, DiskCatalogMaker makes it easy to catalog, browse, and search everything without needing the physical media connected.

The application scans your media and stores an organized catalog that includes folder structures, file names, sizes, creation dates, and other metadata. It supports searching by keyword, filtering results, and even previewing thumbnails of images or documents. This makes it ideal for photographers, editors, archivists, or anyone who regularly works with massive file archives.

Its clean macOS-native interface integrates well with Finder, and catalog files are lightweight and easy to share. DiskCatalogMaker also supports incremental updates, CD-TEXT, and Spotlight integration, giving you more control and speed when managing data at scale.
